## üßÆ Salary Calculator ‚Äì Logic Overview

This script calculates your net salary for each month, considering your joining date, leaves taken, and working schedule. Here‚Äôs how it works:

#### 1. User Inputs
- Monthly Pay: Your gross monthly salary.
- Working Days per Week: How many days you work each week (typically 5 or 6).
- Hours Worked per Day: Your daily working hours.
- Joining Date: The date you started your job.
- Leave Details: For each month (from joining to current), you enter the number of full and half-day leaves.

#### 2. Working Days Calculation
- The script calculates the total number of working days in each month, based on your working days per week (Mon‚ÄìFri or Mon‚ÄìSat).
- For your joining month, it only counts working days from your joining date to the end of that month.

#### 3. Salary Proration
- For the joining month, your gross salary is prorated based on the number of eligible working days.
- For subsequent months, the full monthly salary is considered.

#### 4. Leave Deductions (NEW LOGIC)
- For each month, you enter how many full and half-day leaves you took.
- The script calculates your per-day wage as:  
  **Per-day wage = Prorated monthly salary / actual eligible working days in that month**
- Deduction = (Full Leaves + 0.5 √ó Half-Days) √ó Per-Day Wage
- Deductions are capped so you can't be deducted for more days than you could have worked.

#### 5. Net Salary Calculation
- Net Salary = Prorated Gross Salary ‚Äì Deductions
- The script shows a breakdown for each month (if you choose), and a final summary including:
  - Reference hourly wage
  - Total gross salary (prorated)
  - Total deductions
  - Net salary

#### 6. Monthly Breakdown (Optional)
- You can opt to see detailed monthly breakdowns, which include gross, deductions, and net pay for each month.
